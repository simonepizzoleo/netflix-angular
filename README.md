# Building a Movies repository with Angular 2+

All the Movies inside the app are fetched via an External API and displayed in a Grid. Templating is guaranteed via Angular which comes with a Router, providing a way to display multiple Components as if they were different Pages.

We're using this Router to build the internal detail pages of each Movie by showing its name, a brief description and a call-to-action to watch the Movie (watch feature not included).

## How to run this application

After making sure Angular CLI is installed on your machine, open the folder through your terminal and digit `ng serve` to build the application in Development Mode. Then access it via `localhost:4200` in the URL address bar of your web browser.
